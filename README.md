# ASDF Journal
A simple journal which uses markdown formatting

## Features

### Future Proof

* Journal entries are stored in plaintext markdown files
* Journal file names start with a YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM timestamp so that sorting by name also sorts by date
* Plaintext files will likely be readable for a long time while other propietary formats can become obsolete
